## I Wanna Go Fast
If you don't care about using source control and just want to make something quick:

</summary>

## I Want To Use Source Control
This template is set up to easily make your own GitHub projects, and we highly recommend you take this route.

</summary>

## 1. Make Your Own GitHub Project

Press [![Use This Template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/737888/185467681-e5fdb099-d99f-454b-8d9e-0760e5a6e588.png)](https://github.com/vrchat-community/template-avatar/generate)
to start a new GitHub project, and follow the directions there. This is an optional step but gets you started with using GitHub for source control so you'll always have a backup.

## 2. Clone or Download the Project

If you're not ready to use git yet, you can download a zip of your project by pressing the "Code" button and then "Download Zip".

If you're familiar with git, use your favorite client or the command line to clone your repository.

## 5. Test Your Avatar

</summary>

When you're ready to try out your Avatar, find and choose the menu item "VRChat SDK > Show Control Panel".

* Switch to the "Builder" tab and choose "Build & Test".

* Launch VRChat, open your Avatars menu (click on "Avatars" in your Quick Menu) and look in the "Other" section. Your test avatar will have a temporary name based on the name of the GameObject with the VRC Avatar Descriptor on it. The default name will be "SDK: Tutorial_Robot_Avatar_Dynamics_Demo_v1".
* Select your Test Avatar and press "Test This Avatar" on the left-hand side of your menu.

You should now be testing your custom avatar!

## 6. Publish Your Avatar

</summary>

When you're ready to publish your Avatar so you can use it regularly:
* Return to the VRChat SDK Control Panel in your Unity Project
* Switch to the "Builder" tab and press "Build and Publish for Windows". 
* This will build your Avatar and add some publishing options to your Game window.
* Fill out the required fields "Avatar Name", "Description", "Sharing", and check the terms box "the above information is accurate...".
* Press "Upload".

Return to VRChat - your Avatar should now show up under "My Creations" at the top of the Avatar listing. Choose it and enjoy!
